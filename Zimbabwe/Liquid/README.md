This map was digitized from the publicly available network map at https://www.techzim.co.zw/2013/07/broadband-in-zimbabwe-the-liquid-telecom-fibre-map-july-2013/. It is not a perfect transcription as some routes and locations are hard to make out and/or geo-locate.  Routes are approximations. It is also unfortunately not very recent.
