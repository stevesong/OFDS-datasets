This map was digitized from the publicly available network map announced on [X](https://x.com/Nigerenarabe/status/1990829122113909085) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nt.nigertelecoms/posts/comprendre-pourquoi-laccord-strat%C3%A9gique-entre-niger-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9coms-et-alg%C3%A9rie-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9com-/474818655304077/). It is not a perfect transcription as some routes and locations are hard to make out and/or geo-locate.  Routes are approximations.
