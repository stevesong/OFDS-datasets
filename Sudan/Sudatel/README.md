# Sudatel Sudan #

This map was digitized from the publicly available Sudatel Annual Report at https://drive.google.com/file/d/17FqGiZZHxflbozCE38NoxqKgxXa0s6j2/view . It is not a perfect transcription as some routes and locations are hard to make out and/or geo-locate.  Routes are approximations. It is also unfortunately not very recent.
